Why we are saying this?
Ans: We are saying this because u must have used our command `/help` or `+help` to view the list of all the commands and in the list `RULE` command is mentioned even after checking that and ignoring we cannot tell if u read or not since we do not keep a data of which user has accepted the Rules and which user using the bot didnt..
